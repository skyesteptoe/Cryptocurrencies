# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Accountability Accounting is interested in exploring the cryptocurrency market in order to consider whether it's worth investing. It's overwhelming to grasp and they need some support understanding what's out there. Working with senior manager, Martha, from the Advisory Services Team, we decide to run an unsupervised leaning model using principal components analysis (PCA). This analysis will help inform the firm and allow them to determine if they would like to offer cryptocurrentcy investments as part of their investment portfolio.

We chose unsupervised leaning for this model as we don't have an expected output. We start by preprocessing the data for PCA (Deliverable 1); reduce the data dimensions using PCA (Deliverable 2); cluster cryptocurrencies using the K-means approach (Deliverable 3); and complete our analysis by creating graphs to visualize the cryptocurrency results (Deliverable 4).

## Results
Our results display groups or patterns in the data. This analysis indicates what cryptocurrencies are on the market and how they might be grouped together to create a classification system. The groups created in the classification system could be used to guide new investments into cryptocurrency.
